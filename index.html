            <p>The tragedy was about data breach that happened in 2013. The breach was taking place from mid-November to the rest of the year. The impact of this breach was massive: about 40 million Debit and Credit cards ended up being stolen; about 70 million accounts of personal information were compromised; about 1800 stores were affected. All these impacts lead up to the estimated costs of about 420 million dollars for Target to pay back in legal fees and reimbursement for loss of information. This was the second-largest debit and credit card breach in the United States. The breach was caused by hackers. Hackers compromised a company that can access Target’s network. They used malware called BlackPOS. This malware had extra security measures to keep it from being detected. They collected information in Target’s network and sell it to the black market.</p>
