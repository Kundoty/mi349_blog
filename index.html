            <h3>The Tragedy Happened In Target</h3>
            <address>Andy Liang</address>

            <p>The tragedy was about data breach that happened in 2013. The breach was taking place from mid-November to the rest of the year. The impact of this breach was massive: about 40 million Debit and Credit cards ended up being stolen; about 70 million accounts of personal information were compromised; about 1800 stores were affected. All these impacts lead up to the estimated costs of about 420 million dollars for Target to pay back in legal fees and reimbursement for loss of information. This was the second-largest debit and credit card breach in the United States. The breach was caused by hackers. Hackers compromised a company that can access Target's network. They used malware called BlackPOS. This malware had extra security measures to keep it from being detected. They collected information in Target's network and sell it to the black market.</p>

            <p>This, definitely, was a huge tragedy. There were lots of media reports about it. Many people analyze the event. A tragedy like this could be both bad and good. Bad is because it affected the world and people. But is also beneficial, because nothing is perfect. We're still developing technology. We can not make technology better without each tragedy that happened in the past. We could already learn many lessons from this event. One thing that's obvious is improving network security. What had Target done as they employ executives to oversee a comprehensive data security program. They are also required to hire a third party that will encrypt and protect card information, ensuring their data is secured and unreadable if accessed.</p>

            <h3>Switch From IPv4 to IPv6</h3>
            <address>Andy Liang</address>

            <p>We all know technology is developing, but some older technologies aren't enough to satisfy our demands today. IP address is one of the things. Why switch to IPv6? Well, one of the simple answers could be: It's time for upgrading.</p>
            <p>There're definitely a lot of reasons to switch to IPv6. It has a lot more addresses that can be used. IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. How much different are they? IPv4 generates 4 billion unique addresses, whereas IPv6 generates 340 undecillion addresses (the number looks like 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000), that's a crazy number. That's more than enough for the foreseeable future. We'll never run out of IP addresses. There're some redundant domains in IPv4 header format, but that have been either dropped or listed as extended headers in IPv6 addresses. IPv6 IP header size is 4 times longer than IPv4, but IPv6 headers are only 2 times the size of IPv4. This greatly reduces the overhead of packet processing and header bandwidth and that makes it faster. It also improves routing performance. The IPv4 options are placed in the header while IPv6 is put into separate and extended header. The header won't be processed until you specify a router. IPv6 is also faster than IPv4 because of the lack of network-address translation. </p>
            <p><img src="IPv4-vs-IPv6.png" alt="IPv4 vs IPv6"></p>
            <p>One difficulty we have is converting our device using IPv6. Because we are so adopted of using IPv4, IPv6 is not available on some devices that run IPv4. The world is still slow to convert to IPv6.</p>
