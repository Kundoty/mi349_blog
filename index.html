            <p>The tragedy was about data breach that happened in 2013. The breach was taking place from mid-November to the rest of the year. The impact of this breach was massive: about 40 million Debit and Credit cards ended up being stolen; about 70 million accounts of personal information were compromised; about 1800 stores were affected. All these impacts lead up to the estimated costs of about 420 million dollars for Target to pay back in legal fees and reimbursement for loss of information. This was the second-largest debit and credit card breach in the United States. The breach was caused by hackers. Hackers compromised a company that can access Target's network. They used malware called BlackPOS. This malware had extra security measures to keep it from being detected. They collected information in Target's network and sell it to the black market.</p>

            <p>This, definitely, was a huge tragedy. There were lots of media reports about it. Many people analyze the event. A tragedy like this could be both bad and good. Bad is because it affected the world and people. But is also beneficial, because nothing is perfect. We're still developing technology. We can not make technology better without each tragedy that happened in the past. We could already learn many lessons from this event. One thing that's obvious is improving network security. What had Target done as they employ executives to oversee a comprehensive data security program. They are also required to hire a third party that will encrypt and protect card information, ensuring their data is secured and unreadable if accessed.</p>
